  - `hover-middle-wide-card.css`
  - `hover-product-card.css`
  - `hover-small-card.css`
  - `hover-wide-narrow.css`
  - `hover.css`

  These files control the layout, styles, and responsive behavior for each block, allowing you to customize visuals and animations.

  - `hover.js`

  This file manages interactivity, including hover effects and animations. Modify it to enhance or add new behaviors to the section.

- **Liquid Template**:
  - `sections/hover.liquid`

  This is the main Liquid file for the section, where you can update the structure, include new settings, or add new blocks.

By editing these files, you can adapt the Hover Section to meet specific design requirements or integrate additional functionality to improve user engagement on your Shopify store.
